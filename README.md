# CaptureC-tools

Some programs for downstream analysis of CaptureC data.

#### directionality 
Program to measure any bias in the direction of interactions from a set of CaptureC interaction profiles. Gives a value for each profile/probe. Previously I think I called this asymmetry.

#### log_reads_v_separation
Program to generate the average number of reads as a function of separation from a set of CaptureC interaction profiles. This is done with logarithmically spaced bins and also calculates an error.

#### local_v_long
Program which calculates the ratio between local and long ranged interactions from a set of CaptureC interaction profiles. Gives a value for each profile/probe.
