# CaptureC-tools

Some programs for downstream analysis of CaptureC data.

#### directionality 
Program to measure any bias in the direction of interactions from a set of CaptureC interaction profiles. Previously I think I called this asymmetry.

#### log_reads_v_separation
Program to generate the average number of reads as a function of separation from a set of CaptureC interaction profiles. This is done with logarythmicly spaced bins and also calculates an error.
