#// Program to calculate the derivative of the asymmetry/directionality
#// data generated by the directionality program.
#//
#//***************************************************************************

# To compile:
#
# If make and a c++ compiler are available, an executable can be generated with 
# the command:

make

# The program reads in an output file generated by the directionality program.
# This should contain a directionalities from a set of probes on one chromosome
# from the same condition.

# Command line options are explained if the program is run with no arguments.
# An example command line is:

./direct_derivative -d mydirectionalities.dat -o mydirect_derivatives.dat

# It uses a simple linear interpolation to find the rate of change of the
# directionality between two adjacent probes. It does not care how far apart
# the probes are, so the results might not make sense if they are too far
# apart. If there are N probes, the output will have N-1 derivative values
# positioned at the midpoints between pairs of adjacent probes.
