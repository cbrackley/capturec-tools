#//
#// Program to get the ratio between the number of local and long range 
#// interactions, one value per target.
#//
#//***************************************************************************

# To compile:
#
# If make and a c++ compiler are available, an expecutable can be generated with 
# the command:

make



# The program reads in a bed file which contains a list of targets, and a file
# which contains a list of data file names.

# To reduce biases from binning, use the normalized pile up files generated by 
# capC-MAP.

# There are four one parameters which can be set, the minimum distanct interactions
# which are counted, the maximum distance interactions which are counted, and the
# value of the crossover from what is considered local/long range.
# Defaults are set at 1000bp, 10Mbp, and 100kbp.

# The file containing the list of data files should have the following format:
/path/to/captured_normalizedpileup_probe1.bdg        nameoftarget1
/path/to/captured_normalizedpileup_probe2.bdg        nameoftarget2
# where the absolute or relative path to the file is give. The target name must match one
# of the targets in the targets bed file.

# Command line options are explained if the program is run with no arguments.
# An example command line is:
./local_v_long -t ../Data/targets.bed -f example_filelist.txt -o example_loclong.dat
